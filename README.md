# ViridiX

### Status

This project will be under heavy churn until the porting process has been completed from its [original home](https://github.com/Ernegien/ViridiX).

### About

ViridiX is a collection of libraries and applications designed to communicate with an original Xbox running debug software over a network. The primary goal is to allow for rapid development of debugging tools and scripts on Windows/Linux/Mac.

The solution name is a combination of the Latin word for green, *viridis*, and X for Xbox. The project names within are all loosely artisan-based, currently composed of the following:

  - Mason - Common core library.
  - Linguist - The xbdm communication library.

 ### Instructions

 Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/XboxDev/ViridiX/wiki) for detailed platform-specific information.
